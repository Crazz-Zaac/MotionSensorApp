# Motion Sensor Recorder - Project Summary

## Overview

This project delivers a complete Android Flutter application for recording motion sensor data with activity tagging, TTS alerts, and comprehensive data export functionality. The application successfully combines Flutter's cross-platform UI capabilities with native Kotlin sensor handling to provide precise, high-frequency data collection suitable for research and analysis purposes.

## Key Achievements

### ✅ Core Requirements Fulfilled

1. **Multi-sensor Recording**: Successfully implemented simultaneous recording from accelerometer, gyroscope, magnetometer, and rotation vector sensors with configurable sampling rates (1-200 Hz).

2. **Activity Sequence Management**: Complete UI for creating, editing, and reordering activity sequences with user-defined durations.

3. **TTS Integration**: Comprehensive text-to-speech system with configurable pre-notice timing (percentage or fixed seconds mode).

4. **Data Export**: Robust CSV export with ISO8601 timestamps, chunked buffering to prevent OOM, and proper activity tagging.

5. **Background Recording**: Android foreground service implementation for stable background operation with persistent notifications.

### ✅ Technical Implementation

1. **Flutter-Kotlin Integration**: Seamless communication via MethodChannel and EventChannel for sensor control and data streaming.

2. **Native Sensor Handling**: Kotlin-based sensor management with precise sampling rate control using `registerListener(sensor, samplingPeriodUs)`.

3. **Efficient Data Writing**: Chunked buffered CSV writing with configurable buffer sizes and write intervals.

4. **Foreground Service**: Complete Android service implementation with TTS integration and activity progression logic.

### ✅ User Interface

1. **Four Main Screens**: Activities, Home, Export, and Settings screens with intuitive navigation.

2. **Live Data Visualization**: Real-time plotting of sensor data during recording sessions.

3. **Comprehensive Settings**: Per-sensor sampling rate configuration, TTS preferences, and file format options.

4. **File Management**: Complete recording management with preview, share, export, and delete functionality.

### 4. Platform Channel Examples

**MethodChannel Examples**:
```dart
// Sensor control
await _sensorChannel.invokeMethod('startSensors', {'samplingRates': rates});

// Data recording
await _dataChannel.invokeMethod('startRecording', {'activitySequence': sequence});

// Service control with parameters
await _serviceChannel.invokeMethod('startService', {
  'activitySequence': sequence,
  'preNoticeMode': true,
  'preNoticeValue': 50.0,
  'ttsEnabled': true
});
```

**EventChannel Example**:
```dart
// Real-time sensor data streaming
_sensorStream.receiveBroadcastStream().listen((data) {
  String sensorType = data['sensorType'];
  List<dynamic> values = data['values'];
  int timestamp = data['timestamp'];
  // Process sensor data
});
```

## Acceptance Test Verification

### Test Scenario: 30-Second Recording Sequence

**Configuration**:
- Walk: 10 seconds
- Sit: 10 seconds
- Jump: 10 seconds
- Pre-notice: 50% (5 seconds before each transition)

**Expected TTS Timeline**:
- 0s: "Get ready to Walk for 10 seconds"
- 5s: "Get ready to Sit"
- 10s: "Start Sit now"
- 15s: "Get ready to Jump"
- 20s: "Start Jump now"
- 30s: "End of recording"

**CSV Output Verification**:
```csv
timestamp,accelerometer_x,accelerometer_y,accelerometer_z,gyroscope_x,gyroscope_y,gyroscope_z,magnetometer_x,magnetometer_y,magnetometer_z,rotation_vector_x,rotation_vector_y,rotation_vector_z,rotation_vector_w,activity
